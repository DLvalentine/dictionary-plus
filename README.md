# dictionary-plus
Extension of my fork of dolph/dictionary: A sqlite3 db for the popular.txt containing more information about the words. Word length, definition (sourced from [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)), and so on.
At time of writing, I intend to use [Ruby with Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) to create the DB scripts.
